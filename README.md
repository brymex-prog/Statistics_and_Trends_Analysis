# COVID-19 Statistics and Trends Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses global COVID-19 data to understand how **environmental** and **demographic** factors influenced the spread and severity of the pandemic across countries.  
The analysis focuses on identifying trends, relationships, and patterns in the data using statistical techniques and visualisations.

## Objectives
- Analyse COVID-19 case across countries.
- Examine the impact of demographic factors such as population size, density, and age distribution.
- Explore environmental variables (temperature, humidity, climate indicators) and how they relate to COVID-19 outcomes.
- Identify correlations and statistical relationships between different variables.
- Present findings using clear visualisations and summaries.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- COVID-19 cases 
- Country-level demographic indicators  
- Environmental/climate data (temperature, humidity, etc.)  

Data was cleaned, merged, and prepared before analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values  
   - Standardised column formats  
   - Merged datasets  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics  
   - Trend analysis  
   - Correlation analysis  

3. **Environmental Factor Analysis**
   - Relationship between temperature/humidity and case trends  


4. **Visualisation**
   - Relational plot 
   - Categorical plot 
   - Statistical plot  
    

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that COVID-19 trends were influenced by multiple demographic and environmental factors.  
While no single variable can fully explain the differences between countries, combining statistics and visualisation helps reveal important patterns in how the pandemic evolved globally.
